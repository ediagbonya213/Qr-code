### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Working on this project enabled me to work on the responsiveness of a website and how important the media query can be. I was able to master it as well and will always apply the knowledge in other projects  

css
```
@media screen and (min-width:375px) and (max-width:1440px){
 .container{
    margin: 30% 12%;
 }
}
